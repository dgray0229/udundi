# Udundi Coding Challenge

Recommended IDE Setup

Linked below, you will find a Figma file with a mockup of a simple landing page we created. Please use the design as a guide, and develop the site as closely as possible with the provided assets. Below is a list of requirements and expectations for the challenge:

* [View the design in Figma here](https://t.sidekickopen07.com/s3t/c/5/f18dQhb0V1-gmb8cpmr1W1ls7VQ59hl3kW7_k2841CX6NGN36PP6WrP29BW56JXy7619RB3f197v5Y04?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW4mKLS-3M3CgkW3yMjpk3_rh9hW3ZV6sK3z1Ls7W3y_BF-3JJMfYW3jdf8S4mbn8jW2Ycq4d4hJTXZW1GjGdC3T1k6SW2t02FM3ZVc__W3JNBrX3H4MgpF3GP5x9nv-Z1&si=8000000028411983&pi=5d038e07-83e0-4456-ece9-282df5846cc3)

  * You can either download the necessary assets from Figma or use the assets in the folder attached to this email.
* Use Tailwind ([https://tailwindcss.com/](https://tailwindcss.com/)) Framework
* HTML5, JS, & CSS3 (for brownie points use Vue.JS)
* Please include animations on the page, we have provided a Dribbble example below - the closer you can match it, the better.
* Animate “Explore” on the initial page load
* Animate the text box when the “More Details” button is clicked
* **EXAMPLE** of what we're looking for**:** [https://dribbble.com/shots/3969194-Travel-Agency-Landing-Page](https://dribbble.com/shots/3969194-Travel-Agency-Landing-Page)
